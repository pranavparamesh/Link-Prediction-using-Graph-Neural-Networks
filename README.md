# Link-Prediction-using-Graph-Neural-Networks
GNNs are powerful tools for many machine learning tasks on graphs. This tutorial teaches the basic workflow of using GNNs for link prediction. We again use the Zachery's Karate Club graph but try to predict interactions between two members.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

Prepare training and testing sets for link prediction task.
Build a GNN-based link prediction model.
Train the model and verify the result.
